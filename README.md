##Withdraw Functionality Screenshots: ##
The following screenshots show withdrawing 5 ether into accountOne and 10 ether into accountTwo. After each transaction I used the contractBalance function to verify that the funds were withdrawn from the contract. Finally, I also use the lastToWithdraw and lastWithdrawAmount functions to verify that the address and amount were correct.
